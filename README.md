This is the the partial code for my thesis. A COLREGS-compliant multiship collision avoidance based on deep reinforcement learning. 

With the AI trained with this code, the AI acting as ships will be able to avoid collision with other ships while travelling to their destination , while complying to sea regulations(COLREGS) at the same time.

Depending on python version and package version, you may need to update the or downgrade some package version if you wish to run this code. 

Code is not very well annotated so to prevent any errors , you may want to run the code cell by cell in order to see what is going on.
